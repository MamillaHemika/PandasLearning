\# Apply switch detection

ein_valid_df.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]).apply(detect_switches)

the provided function detect_switches() and perform a dry run using an example DataFrame. The function is designed to identify switches between fully insured (FI) and self-insured (SI) members based on changes in member counts over consecutive years.

**Step 1: Understanding the Code**

**Key Features of the Code**

- The code defines a function, detect_switches(), which operates on groups of data (in this case, groups defined by "EIN" and "Product").
- It sorts the data within each group by "Year".
- It iterates over each row in the group (except the first one, since it compares each row to the previous one).
- It checks for two types of switches:
  - From **FI to SI**: This occurs when the fully insured members (FI) drop to zero while self-insured members (SI) are positive in the previous year.
  - From **SI to FI**: This occurs when self-insured members (SI) drop to zero while fully insured members (FI) are positive in the previous year.
- The relevant information is captured and stored in the switch_cases list.

**Step 2: Set Up Example Data**

We'll create a sample DataFrame that fits the requirements of the function:

import pandas as pd

\# Sample data

data = {

'Year': \[2018, 2019, 2020, 2018, 2019, 2020\],

'EIN': \[123456, 123456, 123456, 789012, 789012, 789012\],

'Product': \['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'\],

'SI': \[10, 12, 0, 5, 0, 8\], # Self Insured

'FI': \[20, 0, 0, 0, 30, 40\] # Fully Insured

}

ein_valid_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("Initial DataFrame:")

print(ein_valid_df)

The DataFrame looks like this:

Year EIN Product SI FI

0 2018 123456 A 10 20

1 2019 123456 A 12 0

2 2020 123456 A 0 0

3 2018 789012 B 5 0

4 2019 789012 B 0 30

5 2020 789012 B 8 40

**Step 3: Dry Run of the Code**

**Applying the Function**

1. **Apply the Function**:
2. ein_valid_df.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]).apply(detect_switches)

**Group 1: (EIN=123456, Product='A')**

The first group contains rows with EIN = 123456 and Product = 'A'.

| **Year** | **EIN** | **Product** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | 123456 | A   | 10  | 20  |
| 2019 | 123456 | A   | 12  | 0   |
| 2020 | 123456 | A   | 0   | 0   |

- **Sorting**: The group is already sorted by "Year".
- **Iteration** (length of group = 3):

**Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:

- prev_row: Year 2018 (SI = 10, FI = 20)
- curr_row: Year 2019 (SI = 12, FI = 0)

prev_fi, curr_fi = 20, 0

prev_si, curr_si = 10, 12

- Check for **FI to SI** switch: prev_fi > 0 and curr_fi == 0 → **True**.
- Log the switch:

switch_cases.append({

"EIN": 123456,

"Product": 'A',

"Year": 2019,

"Switch": "FI to SI",

"Prev_Year": 2018,

"Prev_FI": 20,

"Prev_SI": 10,

"Curr_FI": 0,

"Curr_SI": 12,

"Switched_Members": 20

})

**Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:

- prev_row: Year 2019 (SI = 12, FI = 0)
- curr_row: Year 2020 (SI = 0, FI = 0)

prev_fi, curr_fi = 0, 0

prev_si, curr_si = 12, 0

- Check for **SI to FI** switch: prev_si > 0 and curr_si == 0.
  - prev_si = 12 and curr_si = 0: **True**.
- Log the switch:

switch_cases.append({

"EIN": 123456,

"Product": 'A',

"Year": 2020,

"Switch": "SI to FI",

"Prev_Year": 2019,

"Prev_FI": 0,

"Prev_SI": 12,

"Curr_FI": 0,

"Curr_SI": 0,

"Switched_Members": 12

})

**Group 2: (EIN=789012, Product='B')**

The second group contains rows with EIN = 789012 and Product = 'B'.

| **Year** | **EIN** | **Product** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | 789012 | B   | 5   | 0   |
| 2019 | 789012 | B   | 0   | 30  |
| 2020 | 789012 | B   | 8   | 40  |

- **Sorting**: The group is also already sorted by "Year".
- **Iteration** (length of group = 3):

**Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:

- prev_row: Year 2018 (SI = 5, FI = 0)
- curr_row: Year 2019 (SI = 0, FI = 30)

prev_fi, curr_fi = 0, 30

prev_si, curr_si = 5, 0

- Check for **FI to SI** switch: prev_fi > 0 and curr_fi == 0 → **False**.
- Check for **SI to FI** switch: prev_si > 0 and curr_si == 0 → **True**.
- Log the switch:

switch_cases.append({

"EIN": 789012,

"Product": 'B',

"Year": 2019,

"Switch": "SI to FI",

"Prev_Year": 2018,

"Prev_FI": 0,

"Prev_SI": 5,

"Curr_FI": 30,

"Curr_SI": 0,

"Switched_Members": 5

})

**Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:

- prev_row: Year 2019 (SI = 0, FI = 30)
- curr_row: Year 2020 (SI = 8, FI = 40)

prev_fi, curr_fi = 30, 40

prev_si, curr_si = 0, 8

- Check for **FI to SI** switch: prev_fi > 0 and curr_fi == 0 → **False**.
- Check for **SI to FI** switch: prev_si > 0 and curr_si == 0 → **False**.

**Final Output of switch_cases**

After completing the iterations for all groups, the switch_cases list will contain the following switches:

\[

{'EIN': 123456, 'Product': 'A', 'Year': 2019, 'Switch': 'FI to SI', 'Prev_Year': 2018, 'Prev_FI': 20, 'Prev_SI': 10, 'Curr_FI': 0, 'Curr_SI': 12, 'Switched_Members': 20},

{'EIN': 123456, 'Product': 'A', 'Year': 2020, 'Switch': 'SI to FI', 'Prev_Year': 2019, 'Prev_FI': 0, 'Prev_SI': 12, 'Curr_FI': 0, 'Curr_SI': 0, 'Switched_Members': 12},

{'EIN': 789012, 'Product': 'B', 'Year': 2019, 'Switch': 'SI to FI', 'Prev_Year': 2018, 'Prev_FI': 0, 'Prev_SI': 5, 'Curr_FI': 30, 'Curr_SI': 0, 'Switched_Members': 5}

\]

The choice of columns to use in a groupby() operation in pandas is fundamental to how you structure your data analysis. In your code, the decision to group by "EIN" and "Product" instead of including the "Year" is based on the specific logical operations you want to perform and the context of the analysis.

**Context of the Analysis**

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**:
    - **EIN** (Employer Identification Number): Typically identifies an entity or organization. It serves as a unique identifier and is used to group data related to a specific entity.
    - **Product**: Represents different types of offerings or services. Grouping by product helps to segregate analyses based on the specific product category.
    - **Year**: Represents the time dimension of the data. In your analysis, you are looking to identify switches that occur year-over-year.

**Why Only Group By "EIN" and "Product"?**

- **Analyzing Trends Within Groups**: By grouping by "EIN" and "Product", you're maintaining a focus on each entity-product pairing. This allows you to analyze the trends of FI (Fully Insured) and SI (Self Insured) members over the years within that specific product and organization.
- **Switch Detection Across Years**: The primary goal of the detect_switches function is to track switches from FI to SI or vice versa.
  - Since the analysis is inherently about changes over time (from one year to another), including Year in the groupby operation would complicate the analysis:
    - **Grouping with "Year"**: If you added "Year" to the grouping, each combination of (EIN, Product, Year) would be treated as a separate group. This means you would not be able to compare data year-over-year for the same EIN and Product, which is vital for detecting switches.
  - For example, if the dataset has for a given EIN and Product across 2018 and 2019, adding Year to the groupby() would mean each year gets its own group:
    - Year 2018 would be one group, and year 2019 would be another, effectively losing the ability to compare the two years directly.

**Example to Illustrate**

Let’s say you have the following simplified data for a specific EIN and Product combination across multiple years:

| **Year** | **EIN** | **Product** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | 12345678 | A   | 10  | 20  |
| 2019 | 12345678 | A   | 0   | 25  |
| 2020 | 12345678 | A   | 5   | 0   |

**Grouping by EIN and Product Only**

By grouping by (EIN, Product), your function processes all years under that (EIN, Product) pair together:

- **Group**: (12345678, A)
  - Years (2018, 2019, 2020) within this single group.

You can then analyze the transitions:

- 2018 to 2019: FI drops to 0 while SI goes from 10 to 0 (detect FI to SI switch).
- 2019 to 2020: SI goes to 5 and FI drops to 0 (but since SI was previously 0, you'd not switch here).

**Grouping by EIN, Product, and Year**

If you grouped by all three (EIN, Product, Year):

- You would create groups that are distinct per year:
  - Group (12345678, A, 2018)
  - Group (12345678, A, 2019)
  - Group (12345678, A, 2020)

Now, you can only analyze switches within the same year, which wouldn't help in identifying switches over time:

- You cannot compare years directly to detect the transitions causing switches between FI and SI.

**Conclusion**

By grouping only by EIN and Product, the code retains the ability to analyze trends across years while keeping the focus on specific entities and products. This design is essential for tracking the annual status transitions of members effectively.

If you want to capture switches that happen specifically **across yearly boundaries**, then grouping by Year is not appropriate, whereas keeping the analysis focused on EIN and Product is the correct choice.
