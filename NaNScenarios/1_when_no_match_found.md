If you're encountering a result with all NaN values after the merging operation, it indicates that the merge operation did not find any matching keys between the DataFrames. Let’s troubleshoot this situation step by step.

**Steps to Identify and Fix the Issue**

1. **Verify Unique ID Creation**: Ensure that the unique identifiers you've created actually match in both DataFrames that you're trying to merge.
2. **Check Data Consistency**: Ensure that there are no leading/trailing spaces or differing data types (e.g., integers vs. strings) in the keys you're merging on.
3. **Inspect Intermediate DataFrames**: Before merging, print the contents of the relevant DataFrames to understand their structure and content.

**Debugging Steps**

Let's go through each step:

**Step 1: Print DataFrame Contents**

Before merging, check what your DataFrames look like:

print("ein_valid_df:")

print(ein_valid_df.head())

print("switch_df:")

print(switch_df.head())

\# Check the unique identifiers to be used for merging

print("Unique identifiers in ein_valid_df:")

print(ein_valid_df\[\['Year', 'Product', 'EIN'\]\].drop_duplicates())

print("Unique identifiers in switch_df:")

print(switch_df\[\['Year', 'Product', 'EIN'\]\].drop_duplicates())

**Step 2: Review Merge Keys**

Make sure the columns you're merging on actually contain matching values. You can perform checks like this:

\# Check for unique values in the merge keys for ein_valid_df

print(ein_valid_df\['Year'\].unique())

print(ein_valid_df\['Product'\].unique())

print(ein_valid_df\['EIN'\].unique())

\# Check for unique values in the merge keys for switch_df

print(switch_df\['Year'\].unique())

print(switch_df\['Product'\].unique())

print(switch_df\['EIN'\].unique())

**Step 3: Merge Operation**

Ensure you are merging correctly and using the right columns. The correct merging should look something like this:

\# If you properly collected unique switch information, ensure that the merge uses the correct keys

merged_df = ein_valid_df.merge(

switch_df,

on=\["EIN", "Product", "Year"\], # Ensure these columns exist in both DataFrames

how="left"

).fillna(0)

**Step 4: Check for Data Types**

Sometimes issues arise due to different data types (e.g., one DataFrame has an int while the other has a str for the same column). Ensure the columns you are merging on have the same data type:

\# Check data types

print(ein_valid_df.dtypes)

print(switch_df.dtypes)

\# If necessary, convert data types to match

\# Example means converting to string if that's what you want

ein_valid_df\['EIN'\] = ein_valid_df\['EIN'\].astype(str)

switch_df\['EIN'\] = switch_df\['EIN'\].astype(str)

**Handle NaNs in Merged Data**

After fixing the merge issue, if you still see NaNs, it indicates that those EINs didn't have any switches recorded in the switch_df. This might be expected for certain years or products that didn’t switch.

**Summary of What to Check:**

1. **Print DataFrames**: Look at head() of both ein_valid_df and switch_df.
2. **Check Unique Identifiers**: Use drop_duplicates() and unique() to debug values.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure columns are trimmed of whitespace and are of the same data type across DataFrames.
4. **Merging**: Confirm you are merging on existing columns.

**Example of Complete Check and Merge**

Here’s how you could combine these suggestions into a cohesive check:

\# Check both DataFrames for mismatches in merge keys

print("ein_valid_df Keys:")

print(ein_valid_df\[\['Year', 'Product', 'EIN'\]\].drop_duplicates())

print("switch_df Keys:")

print(switch_df\[\['Year', 'Product', 'EIN'\]\].drop_duplicates())

\# Type checking and converting if needed

print("Data types before merge:")

print(ein_valid_df.dtypes)

print(switch_df.dtypes)

\# Convert if necessary

\# Example conversion

ein_valid_df\['EIN'\] = ein_valid_df\['EIN'\].astype(str)

switch_df\['EIN'\] = switch_df\['EIN'\].astype(str)

\# Finally merge and check the result

merged_df = ein_valid_df.merge(

switch_df,

on=\["EIN", "Product", "Year"\],

how="left"

).fillna(0)

print("Merged DataFrame:")

print(merged_df.head())
