\# Convert switch cases into a DataFrame

switch_df = pd.DataFrame(switch_cases)  
<br/>the root cause of the NaN values in the Switch_Number column in your switch_df.

The Switch_Number column derives its values from the switch_counter dictionary, which increments each time a switch is detected from "FI to SI" or "SI to FI." If you find NaN values in that column, it indicates that no switches were detected during the processing.

**Reasons for NaN Values in Switch_Number**

1. **No Switches Detected**: The most common reason for NaN values is that your code did not detect any switches between FI and SI. The switch_counter\[ein\] value is only updated if the specified conditions in your if statements are met.
2. **Data Conditions Not Met**: For the switch conditions:
    - **For "FI to SI" switch**: The condition checks if prev_fi > 0 and curr_fi == 0. If the previous year's FI member count is not greater than zero, the condition will fail.
    - **For "SI to FI" switch**: The condition checks if prev_si > 0 and curr_si == 0. Similarly, if the previous year's SI member count is not greater than zero, the condition will fail.
3. **Grouping Issues**: If your DataFrame ein_valid_df does not have sufficient years of data for a given EIN and Product, the loop will not run enough times to detect any switches. For example, if an EIN has only one year of data, no switches can be detected.
4. **Data Preparation**: The way your input data is filtered or how the grouping logic is applied could lead to missing data points. For example, if the data for EIN and Product is incorrectly aggregated or filtered out before applying this logic, it could lead to nothing being processed.

**Example Analysis**

To illustrate, letâ€™s consider a hypothetical scenario:

**Example DataFrame**

Let's say ein_valid_df looks like this:

| **EIN** | **Product** | **Year** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 123 | Dental | 2015 | 50  | 0   |
| 123 | Dental | 2016 | 0   | 100 |
| 123 | Dental | 2017 | 75  | 0   |

**In this case:**

- For 2015 to 2016: Switch **from SI to FI** is detected (condition met).
- For 2016 to 2017: Switch **from FI to SI** is detected (condition met).

In both cases, the switch_counter for EIN 123 would increment, resulting in switch numbers being recorded. If your actual data doesn't have such switching conditions, the Switch_Number would remain NaN.

**Debugging Steps**

To pinpoint exactly why you're seeing NaN values in the Switch_Number column, consider the following steps:

1. **Print Intermediate Values**: Inside the loop, print out the prev_fi, curr_fi, prev_si, and curr_si values being evaluated:
2. print(f"Processing: Prev FI: {prev_fi}, Curr FI: {curr_fi}, Prev SI: {prev_si}, Curr SI: {curr_si}")
3. **Check the Data Before Grouping**: Ensure ein_valid_df has the correct structure:
4. print(ein_valid_df\[\['EIN', 'Product', 'Year', 'SI', 'FI'\]\].head())
5. **Look for Grouping Issues**: Before calling apply, check how many groups are formed:
6. print(ein_valid_df.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]).size())
7. **Count Switch Occurrences**: Use a counter to see how many times each switch condition is met after executing the detect_switches:
8. \# At the end of detect_switches, consider adding:
9. print(f"Total FI to SI switches detected for EIN {ein}: {switch_counter.get(ein, 0)}")

**Conclusion**

By following these checks and examining your data carefully, you should be able to determine:

- Why no switches are being detected,
- Whether your conditions for detecting switches are suitable,
- If the data is sufficient to find any switching events.
