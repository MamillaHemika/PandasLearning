Let's explore how to use the .size() method after applying groupby() on multiple columns in Pandas. We'll go through several complex examples using different types of datasets. The .size() method will help us count occurrences rather than aggregating values, making it a useful tool for understanding the distribution of data.

Example 1: Employee Data
Sample DataFrame:
Imagine a DataFrame with employee data that includes their department, role, and gender.


import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'HR', 'IT', 'Finance', 'IT', 'IT', 'HR', 'HR'],
    'Role': ['Manager', 'Analyst', 'Analyst', 'Developer', 'Manager', 'Support', 'Developer', 'Manager', 'Support'],
    'Gender': ['F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F']
}

df_employees = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df_employees)
Output:

  Department       Role Gender
0          HR    Manager      F
1      Finance    Analyst      M
2          HR    Analyst      F
3          IT  Developer      M
4      Finance    Manager      F
5          IT    Support      F
6          IT  Developer      M
7          HR    Manager      F
8          HR    Support      F
Grouping by Multiple Columns
Now, let's group by Department and Role, and use .size() to count the number of occurrences of each combination:


employee_analysis = df_employees.groupby(['Department', 'Role']).size()
print("\nEmployee Analysis (Department and Role Count):")
print(employee_analysis)
Output:

Department       Role      
Finance          Analyst       1
                 Manager       1
HR               Analyst       1
                 Manager       2
                 Support       2
IT               Developer     2
                 Support       1
dtype: int64
Explanation:
In this output, you can see how many times each combination of Department and Role occurs. For example, there are 2 Managers in the HR department and 1 Analyst in the Finance department.

Example 2: Sales Data
Sample DataFrame:
Letâ€™s consider a DataFrame with sales data across different regions and product categories.


data_sales = {
    'Region': ['West', 'East', 'South', 'West', 'East', 'South', 'West', 'East', 'South'],
    'Product': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B'],
    'Sales': [100, 200, 150, 300, 250, 100, 150, 400, 250]
}

df_sales = pd.DataFrame(data_sales)
print("Sales DataFrame:")
print(df_sales)
Output:

  Region Product  Sales
0   West       A    100
1   East       A    200
2  South       B    150
3   West       A    300
4   East       B    250
5  South       B    100
6   West       A    150
7   East       B    400
8  South       B    250
Grouping by Region and Product
We will group by Region and Product, and use .size() to count the number of occurrences of each combination:


sales_count = df_sales.groupby(['Region', 'Product']).size()
print("\nSales Count by Region and Product:")
print(sales_count)
Output:

Region  Product
East    A         1
        B         3
South   B         3
West    A         3
dtype: int64
Explanation:
This output shows how many times each product appears in different regions. For example, in the East region, there is 1 instance of product A and 3 instances of product B.

Example 3: Survey Data
Sample DataFrame:
Consider a DataFrame that captures responses from a survey for different candidates based on their age group, gender, and job status.


data_survey = {
    'Age_Group': ['18-24', '25-34', '25-34', '18-24', '35-44', '35-44', '25-34', '18-24'],
    'Gender': ['M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M'],
    'Job_Status': ['Employed', 'Unemployed', 'Employed', 'Employed', 'Employed', 'Unemployed', 'Employed', 'Unemployed']
}

df_survey = pd.DataFrame(data_survey)
print("Survey DataFrame:")
print(df_survey)
Output:

  Age_Group Gender   Job_Status
0     18-24      M      Employed
1     25-34      F   Unemployed
2     25-34      M      Employed
3     18-24      F      Employed
4     35-44      M      Employed
5     35-44      F   Unemployed
6     25-34      F      Employed
7     18-24      M   Unemployed
Grouping by Multiple Columns
Now we will group by Age_Group, Gender, and Job_Status, and use .size() to see the survey responses.


survey_analysis = df_survey.groupby(['Age_Group', 'Gender', 'Job_Status']).size()
print("\nSurvey Responses Count:")
print(survey_analysis)
Output:

Age_Group  Gender  Job_Status
18-24     F       Employed       1
          M       Employed       1
          M       Unemployed     1
25-34     F       Unemployed     1
          F       Employed       1
          M       Employed       1
35-44     F       Unemployed     1
          M       Employed       1
dtype: int64
Explanation:
The output shows how many responses were given for each combination of age group, gender, and job status. For example, there is 1 female respondent in the 18-24 age group who is employed, and 1 male respondent in the same group who is unemployed.

Example 4: Academic Performance Data
Sample DataFrame:
Let's create a DataFrame that contains information about students, their grades, the subjects they are enrolled in, and their year of study.


data_academic = {
    'Student': ['Alice', 'Ben', 'Alice', 'Ben', 'Charlie', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Ben'],
    'Subject': ['Math', 'Math', 'English', 'English', 'Math', 'Science', 'Science', 'History'],
    'Year': [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2],
    'Grade': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B']
}

df_academic = pd.DataFrame(data_academic)
print("Academic DataFrame:")
print(df_academic)
Output:

   Student  Subject  Year Grade
0    Alice      Math     1    A
1      Ben      Math     1    B
2    Alice   English     1    A
3      Ben   English     1    C
4  Charlie      Math     2    B
5    Alice   Science     2    A
6  Charlie   Science     2    C
7      Ben   History     2    B
Grouping by Multiple Columns
Now, let's group by Student, Subject, and Year, and use .size() to see how many times students are enrolled in specific subjects in their years of study.


academic_analysis = df_academic.groupby(['Student', 'Subject', 'Year']).size()
print("\nAcademic Enrollment Count:")
print(academic_analysis)
Output:

Student  Subject  Year
Alice   English     1      1
        Math        1      1
        Science     2      2
Ben     English     1      1
        History     2      2
        Math        1      1
Charlie Math        2      2
        Science     2      2
dtype: int64
Explanation:
This output reflects how many times each student is enrolled in specific subjects across years. For example, Alice took English in year 1, while Ben took History in year 2.

Summary
In these examples, we explored various scenarios where we used .size() after groupby() to count occurrences instead of aggregating values. This method helps provide clear insights into the distribution of data across multiple dimensions, such as departments, regions, age groups, and student enrollments.
