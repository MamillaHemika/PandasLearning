iloc is a powerful feature in the pandas library, used to access rows and columns in a DataFrame by integer-based indexing. This means you can reference rows and columns by their positions (indices) rather than by their labels. Here’s a detailed explanation with various scenarios, examples, and dry runs.

**Basic Syntax of iloc**

The basic structure of using iloc is as follows:

DataFrame.iloc\[&lt;row_index&gt;, &lt;column_index&gt;\]

- &lt;row_index&gt;: Index (or list of indices) of the rows you want to access. It can be a single integer, a slice (e.g., :, start:end), or a list of integers.
- &lt;column_index&gt;: Index (or list of indices) of the columns you want to access, using the same rules as for rows.

**Scenarios and Examples**

Let’s start with setting up a sample DataFrame to use in our various examples:

import pandas as pd

data = {

'A': \[1, 2, 3, 4\],

'B': \[5, 6, 7, 8\],

'C': \[9, 10, 11, 12\]

}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)

The DataFrame df looks like this:

A B C

0 1 5 9

1 2 6 10

2 3 7 11

3 4 8 12

**1\. Accessing a Single Value**

To access a single value, specify the row and column indices:

\# Accessing the value at row index 1 (2nd row) and column index 0 (1st column)

value = df.iloc\[1, 0\]

print(value) # Output: 2

**Dry Run:**

- Here, df.iloc\[1, 0\] retrieves the value from the 2nd row and 1st column which is 2.

**2\. Accessing a Row**

You can access an entire row by specifying the row index and using : for column indices:

\# Accessing the entire 2nd row

row = df.iloc\[1, :\]

print(row)

**Output:**

A 2

B 6

C 10

Name: 1, dtype: int64

**Dry Run:**

- df.iloc\[1, :\] retrieves all columns for the 2nd row, resulting in a Series object.

**3\. Accessing Multiple Rows**

You can access multiple rows by passing a list or using a slice:

\# Accessing the 1st and 3rd rows

rows = df.iloc\[\[0, 2\], :\]

print(rows)

**Output:**

A B C

0 1 5 9

2 3 7 11

**Dry Run:**

- df.iloc\[\[0, 2\], :\] retrieves both the 1st and 3rd rows and returns a new DataFrame.

**4\. Accessing Multiple Columns**

You can also select specific columns:

\# Accessing the 1st and 2nd columns for all rows

columns = df.iloc\[:, \[0, 1\]\]

print(columns)

**Output:**

A B

0 1 5

1 2 6

2 3 7

3 4 8

**Dry Run:**

- df.iloc\[:, \[0, 1\]\] retrieves all rows for the 1st and 2nd columns.

**5\. Accessing a Subset of the DataFrame**

To extract a specific block of the DataFrame:

\# Accessing rows 1 to 3 (2nd to 4th) and columns 0 to 1 (1st and 2nd)

subset = df.iloc\[1:4, 0:2\]

print(subset)

**Output:**

A B

1 2 6

2 3 7

3 4 8

**Dry Run:**

- df.iloc\[1:4, 0:2\] slices the DataFrame to get rows 2, 3, and 4 and the first two columns.

**6\. Conditional Selection with iloc**

While iloc itself doesn’t support conditional selection directly, you can still use boolean indexing with it:

\# Selecting rows where the first column's values are greater than 2

condition = df.iloc\[:, 0\] > 2 # Getting a boolean Series

filtered_df = df.iloc\[condition.values\]

print(filtered_df)

**Output:**

A B C

2 3 7 11

3 4 8 12

**Dry Run:**

- The condition creates a boolean mask \[False, False, True, True\], and iloc uses this mask to filter rows.
