**1\. Setting Up the DataFrame**

We will start with a DataFrame similar to what we've used before:

import pandas as pd

data = {

'Name': \['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'\],

'Age': \[24, 30, 22, 28\],

'City': \['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'San Francisco'\]

}

\# Creating the DataFrame

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

\# Setting the 'Name' column as the index

df.set_index('Name', inplace=True)

print(df)

The resulting DataFrame df looks like this:

Age City

Name

Alice 24 New York

Bob 30 Los Angeles

Charlie 22 Chicago

David 28 San Francisco

**2\. Basic Conditional Filtering**

Let's consider a simple conditional filter where we want to find all individuals older than 25.

**Condition: df\['Age'\] > 25**

1. **Condition Evaluation**:
    - The expression df\['Age'\] > 25 creates a boolean Series that indicates True or False for each row based on whether the condition is satisfied.

Here’s the evaluation step-by-step:

\# Evaluating the condition

age_condition = df\['Age'\] > 25

print(age_condition)

**Output**:

Name

Alice False

Bob True

Charlie False

David True

Name: Age, dtype: bool

- **Dry run of this step**:
  - For Alice: 24 > 25 → False
  - For Bob: 30 > 25 → True
  - For Charlie: 22 > 25 → False
  - For David: 28 > 25 → True

1. **Using the Condition with .loc\[\]**:
    - Now, we can use this boolean Series to filter our DataFrame with .loc\[\].

\# Applying the condition

filtered_df = df.loc\[df\['Age'\] > 25\]

print(filtered_df)

**Output**:

Age City

Name

Bob 30 Los Angeles

David 28 San Francisco

- **Behind the scenes**:
  - The boolean mask \[False, True, False, True\] from the previous step is used to select rows.
  - Rows corresponding to True values (Bob and David) are returned, while rows corresponding to False (Alice and Charlie) are excluded.

**3\. Multiple Conditions**

Now, let’s say we want to filter for people who are either older than 25 **or** live in 'New York'.

**Conditions: df\['Age'\] > 25 or df\['City'\] == 'New York'**

1. **Combining Conditions**:
    - Use the logical | operator to create a combined condition.

\# Combined condition

combined_condition = (df\['Age'\] > 25) | (df\['City'\] == 'New York')

print(combined_condition)

**Output**:

Name

Alice True

Bob True

Charlie False

David True

Name: Age, dtype: bool

- **Dry run step**:
  - For Alice: False or True (because she is in 'New York') → True
  - For Bob: True or False → True
  - For Charlie: False or False → False
  - For David: True or False → True

1. **Using the Combined Condition**:

\# Filtering using the combined condition

filtered_combined_df = df.loc\[combined_condition\]

print(filtered_combined_df)

**Output**:

Age City

Name

Alice 24 New York

Bob 30 Los Angeles

David 28 San Francisco

- **Behind the scenes**:
  - The boolean series after applying the combined condition is \[True, True, False, True\].
  - Rows for Alice, Bob, and David are returned as they satisfy one of the conditions.

**4\. Using Conditions for Column Selection**

Now, suppose we want to find out just the names and ages of people who meet our conditions.

1. **Applying the Condition for Column Selection**:

\# Extracting just the 'Age' for the filtered condition

filtered_names_ages = df.loc\[combined_condition, \['Age'\]\]

print(filtered_names_ages)

**Output**:

Age

Name

Alice 24

Bob 30

David 28

- **Behind the scenes**:
  - The same boolean mask is applied, but this time only the 'Age' column is selected, resulting in the names and their ages.

**5\. Using isin() for Filtering**

Another way to filter is by using isin() which checks if values in a column are present in a list.

**Example: Filter by City Names**

1. **Condition: Cities in a List**:

\# Cities to filter

cities_to_filter = \['New York', 'Chicago'\]

\# Using isin()

city_condition = df\['City'\].isin(cities_to_filter)

print(city_condition)

**Output**:

Name

Alice True

Bob False

Charlie True

David False

Name: City, dtype: bool

- **Dry run step**:
  - For Alice: New York is in the list → True
  - For Bob: Los Angeles is not in the list → False
  - For Charlie: Chicago is in the list → True
  - For David: San Francisco is not in the list → False

1. **Filtering with isin()**:

\# Using city condition to filter

filtered_city_df = df.loc\[city_condition\]

print(filtered_city_df)

**Output**:

Age City

Name

Alice 24 New York

Charlie 22 Chicago

- **Explanation**:
  - The boolean series \[True, False, True, False\] results in only Alice and Charlie being included in the output DataFrame.

**Conclusion**

In summary, conditional filtering with .loc\[\] allows you to access specific rows in a DataFrame based on logical conditions. Here's a recap of behind-the-scenes processes:

1. **Condition Evaluation**: When you apply a condition (like df\['Age'\] > 25), pandas creates a boolean Series that represents the outcome of the condition for each row.
2. **Boolean Masking**: This boolean Series is then used as a mask to filter the rows in the DataFrame.
3. **Combination of Conditions**: You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators (& for AND, | for OR) to create a complex filter.
4. **Column Selection**: You can also select specific columns based on filtered rows, allowing for flexible data manipulation.
