The starting DataFrame (group_by) is structured as follows:

| **Year** | **Product** | **EIN** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2015 | Dental | 10024370 | 0.0 | 301.0 |
| 2015 | Dental | 10024570 | 0.0 | 242.0 |
| 2015 | Dental | 10026590 | 4634.0 | 0.0 |
| 2015 | Dental | 10064270 | 0.0 | 409.0 |
| 2015 | Dental | 10067810 | 0.0 | 428.0 |

**The filter() Operation**

You have this line of code:

ein_nonzero = group_by.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]).filter(

lambda x: not any((x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0))

)

**Breakdown of the Code**

1. **Grouping**:
    - group_by.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]) groups the original DataFrame by the columns "EIN" and "Product". In this case, it seems likely that all rows in your sample belong to different EINs or the same EIN with the "Product" being "Dental".
2. **Applying the Filter**:
    - .filter(lambda x: not any((x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0))) applies a filter based on a condition defined in the lambda function.
    - For each group x, the expression (x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0) evaluates whether both SI and FI are zero.

**Detailed Evaluation of the Condition**

Let's break down the lambda function:

- **What it does**:
  - **(x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0)**: This will create a boolean Series that is True where both SI and FI are 0.
  - **any(...)**: This checks if any of those values are True. If any row within that group has both SI and FI equal to 0, any() returns True.
- **not any(...)**: This means that if the group **does not** contain any rows where both SI and FI are 0, the condition is satisfied, and the group will be retained.

**Example Dry Run with Sample Data**

Given your DataFrame, let's assume we have the following groups based on EIN and Product. Based on the provided data, let's treat them as single groups due to unique EINs.

**Grouping:**

For instance, if all the entries above belong to EIN = 10024370, let's evaluate the group:

x = group_by\[group_by\['EIN'\] == 10024370\]

| **Year** | **Product** | **EIN** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2015 | Dental | 10024370 | 0.0 | 301.0 |

- Applying the condition (x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0) gives:
  - For the only row: (0.0 == 0) & (301.0 == 0) → True & False → False
- Since there are no rows where both SI and FI are 0, any(False) returns False.

not any((x\["SI"\] == 0) & (x\["FI"\] == 0)) # This evaluates to True

Thus, this group remains in the output.

**Example Evaluation for Each Row**

Let's evaluate groups by EIN:

1. **Group 1 (EIN=10024370)**:
    - Rows:
        - **Row 0**: SI=0.0, FI=301.0
    - Condition check: not any(False) → True (keeps this group).
2. **Group 2 (EIN=10024570)**:
    - Rows:
        - **Row 1**: SI=0.0, FI=242.0
    - Condition check: not any(False) → True (keeps this group).
3. **Group 3 (EIN=10026590)**:
    - Rows:
        - **Row 2**: SI=4634.0, FI=0.0
    - Condition check: not any(False) → True (keeps this group).
4. **Group 4 (EIN=10064270)**:
    - Rows:
        - **Row 3**: SI=0.0, FI=409.0
    - Condition check: not any(False) → True (keeps this group).
5. **Group 5 (EIN=10067810)**:
    - Rows:
        - **Row 4**: SI=0.0, FI=428.0
    - Condition check: not any(False) → True (keeps this group).

**Resulting DataFrame**

After applying the filter, the resulting DataFrame (ein_nonzero) contains the same data as the original DataFrame because all groups remain. Thus, both group_by.head() and ein_nonzero.head() yield identical outputs as they did not get filtered out based on the provided condition.

**Summary**

- The filter method evaluates each group based on a condition specified in the lambda function.
- Groups remain only if there are **no rows** in that group where both SI and FI are equal to 0.
- Since none of your provided rows fulfill the filtering condition of having both SI and FI as 0, all the data points were retained in ein_nonzero.
