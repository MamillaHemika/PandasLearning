\# Apply switch detection

ein_valid_df.groupby(\["EIN", "Product"\]).apply(detect_switches)

The choice of columns to use in a groupby() operation in pandas is fundamental to how you structure your data analysis. In your code, the decision to group by "EIN" and "Product" instead of including the "Year" is based on the specific logical operations you want to perform and the context of the analysis.

**Context of the Analysis**

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**:
    - **EIN** (Employer Identification Number): Typically identifies an entity or organization. It serves as a unique identifier and is used to group data related to a specific entity.
    - **Product**: Represents different types of offerings or services. Grouping by product helps to segregate analyses based on the specific product category.
    - **Year**: Represents the time dimension of the data. In your analysis, you are looking to identify switches that occur year-over-year.

**Why Only Group By "EIN" and "Product"?**

- **Analyzing Trends Within Groups**: By grouping by "EIN" and "Product", you're maintaining a focus on each entity-product pairing. This allows you to analyze the trends of FI (Fully Insured) and SI (Self Insured) members over the years within that specific product and organization.
- **Switch Detection Across Years**: The primary goal of the detect_switches function is to track switches from FI to SI or vice versa.
  - Since the analysis is inherently about changes over time (from one year to another), including Year in the groupby operation would complicate the analysis:
    - **Grouping with "Year"**: If you added "Year" to the grouping, each combination of (EIN, Product, Year) would be treated as a separate group. This means you would not be able to compare data year-over-year for the same EIN and Product, which is vital for detecting switches.
  - For example, if the dataset has for a given EIN and Product across 2018 and 2019, adding Year to the groupby() would mean each year gets its own group:
    - Year 2018 would be one group, and year 2019 would be another, effectively losing the ability to compare the two years directly.

**Example to Illustrate**

Letâ€™s say you have the following simplified data for a specific EIN and Product combination across multiple years:

| **Year** | **EIN** | **Product** | **SI** | **FI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | 12345678 | A   | 10  | 20  |
| 2019 | 12345678 | A   | 0   | 25  |
| 2020 | 12345678 | A   | 5   | 0   |

**Grouping by EIN and Product Only**

By grouping by (EIN, Product), your function processes all years under that (EIN, Product) pair together:

- **Group**: (12345678, A)
  - Years (2018, 2019, 2020) within this single group.

You can then analyze the transitions:

- 2018 to 2019: FI drops to 0 while SI goes from 10 to 0 (detect FI to SI switch).
- 2019 to 2020: SI goes to 5 and FI drops to 0 (but since SI was previously 0, you'd not switch here).

**Grouping by EIN, Product, and Year**

If you grouped by all three (EIN, Product, Year):

- You would create groups that are distinct per year:
  - Group (12345678, A, 2018)
  - Group (12345678, A, 2019)
  - Group (12345678, A, 2020)

Now, you can only analyze switches within the same year, which wouldn't help in identifying switches over time:

- You cannot compare years directly to detect the transitions causing switches between FI and SI.

**Conclusion**

By grouping only by EIN and Product, the code retains the ability to analyze trends across years while keeping the focus on specific entities and products. This design is essential for tracking the annual status transitions of members effectively.

If you want to capture switches that happen specifically **across yearly boundaries**, then grouping by Year is not appropriate, whereas keeping the analysis focused on EIN and Product is the correct choice.
