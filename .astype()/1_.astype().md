switch_df\['SI_EIN_Switch'\] = (switch_df\['Switch'\] == 'SI to FI').astype(int)

**Explanation of the Code**

1. **Understanding the DataFrame**:  
    The variable switch_df is expected to be a pandas DataFrame that contains a column labeled "Switch". This column likely holds string values indicating the type of switch, such as "FI to SI" or "SI to FI".
2. **Condition Check**:
    - The expression switch_df\['Switch'\] == 'SI to FI' creates a boolean Series. This Series will have True where the "Switch" column has the value 'SI to FI', and False otherwise.

For example, if switch_df looks like this:

| **Index** | **Switch** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | FI to SI |
| 1   | SI to FI |
| 2   | FI to SI |
| 3   | SI to FI |
| 4   | SI to FI |

The expression switch_df\['Switch'\] == 'SI to FI' would evaluate to:

| **Index** | **Switch** | **Condition** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | FI to SI | False |
| 1   | SI to FI | True |
| 2   | FI to SI | False |
| 3   | SI to FI | True |
| 4   | SI to FI | True |

1. **Convert Boolean Values to Integers**:
    - The result of the boolean comparison is converted to integers using the .astype(int) method. In pandas (and numpy), True is treated as 1 and False is treated as 0.

This means our boolean Series from the previous step would be converted to:

| **Index** | **Condition** | **Converted to** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | False | 0   |
| 1   | True | 1   |
| 2   | False | 0   |
| 3   | True | 1   |
| 4   | True | 1   |

1. **Assign to New Column**:
    - The result is then assigned to a new column in the DataFrame called SI_EIN_Switch.

So the final switch_df would look like this:

| **Index** | **Switch** | **SI_EIN_Switch** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | FI to SI | 0   |
| 1   | SI to FI | 1   |
| 2   | FI to SI | 0   |
| 3   | SI to FI | 1   |
| 4   | SI to FI | 1   |
