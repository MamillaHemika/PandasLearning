ein_valid_df\['EIN_FI'\] = (ein_valid_df\['FI'\] > 0).astype(int)

**Explanation of the Code**

1. **Understanding the DataFrame**:
    - The variable ein_valid_df is expected to be a pandas DataFrame that contains a column labeled "FI". This column presumably holds numeric values representing the count of Fully Insured (FI) members.
2. **Condition Check**:
    - The expression ein_valid_df\['FI'\] > 0 creates a boolean Series. This Series will have **True** for each row where the value in the "FI" column is greater than 0, and **False** where the value is 0 or less.

For example, if ein_valid_df looks like this:

| **Index** | **FI** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 10  |
| 1   | 0   |
| 2   | 5   |
| 3   | \-3 |
| 4   | 8   |

The expression ein_valid_df\['FI'\] > 0 evaluates to:

| **Index** | **FI** | **Condition** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 10  | True |
| 1   | 0   | False |
| 2   | 5   | True |
| 3   | \-3 | False |
| 4   | 8   | True |

1. **Convert Boolean Values to Integers**:
    - The result of the boolean comparison is then converted to integers using the .astype(int) method. In pandas (and numpy), **True** becomes **1**, and **False** becomes **0**.

This means that our boolean Series from the previous step would be converted to:

| **Index** | **Condition** | **Converted to** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | True | 1   |
| 1   | False | 0   |
| 2   | True | 1   |
| 3   | False | 0   |
| 4   | True | 1   |

1. **Assign to New Column**:
    - The result (the integer representation of the conditions) is then assigned to a new column in the DataFrame called EIN_FI.

So the final ein_valid_df would look like this:

| **Index** | **FI** | **EIN_FI** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 10  | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 2   | 5   | 1   |
| 3   | \-3 | 0   |
| 4   | 8   | 1   |
